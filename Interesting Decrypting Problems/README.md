The first task was to find flaws in the given cryptographic algorithm. The algorithm was not explicitly given, but instead a C program was provided. 
It is a known fact that the headers of a certain file types can be used to get the size, type and other information about a file. The given algorithm did not make any changes to the first 4 bytes of the files, and stored the size of the file as it is. This is enough information to get the type of the file being sent. The subsequent operations are all XOR operations which means that the plain text value is reversible and it can be got by XORing the result with the 2nd operand.

The second task was to find the key. We were given a pdf file and a png file. As mentioned in the previous section, enough information is contained in their headers compute the key. We were successfully able to find the key by XORing the file type with the header cipher. Then we entered the key and decrypted the whole file. This was not the case for text files as the file type is not mentioned in the headers. But, what helped us to find the key for the text file is that they only contain ASCII characters. Therefore, we try all the combinations of key and try till we get a plaintext with all ASCII values.

# CryptographyWork
In this repository, I have added a few documents and assignments related to Cryptography. Some documents may contain opinions about why a system may fail or why it is a good system. Anybody is open to conflict my ideas.

1. The portfolio document covers a list of topics that I have covered during the Applied Cryptography course that I took. 

2. Nonce and RSA document contains my thoughts about why that public key cryptography system works or doesn't work and states how RSA doesn't stand well when using small primes.

3. My algorithm repo is something Anand and I came up with. We feel it is a good algorithm and it holds strong. We are open to suggestions and improvement.

4. Interesting Decryptions is a folder where through Brute Force attack, we decrypted a text file(Since text files only contain ASCII) and we decrypted a png and pdf file using the XOR in their headers.

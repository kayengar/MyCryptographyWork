# CryptographyWork
In this repository, I have added a few documents and assignments related to Cryptography. Some documents may contain opinions about why a system may fail or why it is a good system. Anybody is open to conflict my ideas.

1. The portfolio document covers a list of topics that I have covered during the Applied Cryptography course that I took. 

2. Nonce and RSA document contains my thoughts about why that public key cryptography system works or doesn't work and states how RSA doesn't stand well when using small primes.
